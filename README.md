# API Gateway (NginX & Docker)

Welcome! I'm a API-Gateway built using NginX. Well almost ;) I'm a P.O.C. and my creator works on: integrations, automations & testing now...

## Quickstart

Make sure you have a local installation of `docker` and `docker-compose`.
Ready? Great, then one, two & three:

1. Download repository:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/scha-ch/api-gateway
   ```

2. Move into directory and install packages via npm:

   ```bash
    cd api-gateway && npm i
   ```

3. Build & Run the gateway:
   ```bash
    npm run build
   ```
