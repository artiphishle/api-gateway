# API Gateway (NginX & Docker)

NginX API Gateway built by Docker, specifically `docker-compose`.

## Quickstart

**Don't.** Work in progress.

## P.O.C.

For now the goal is to start one API (chess-api) using this API gateway. No automations, just prove that it works.

I'm going to keep you posted...

## Workflow

TODO:

1. Read a `.yml` config to specify API's (dockerized github repos) which should be `.gitignore`'d (provide a sample instead).
2. Config API Gateway depending on API config.
3. Run `docker-compose` to start the API gateway and its API's.

## Authentication

Work in progress.

## Analytics

Work in progress.

## How to contribute

ATM Just write an issue, and I will answer ASAP.
